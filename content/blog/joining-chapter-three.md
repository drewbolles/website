Exciting news! After some recent bouts of soul searching, I once again entered the job market. Orlando, Florida has been awesome to me, but I realized I needed a bit more out of my career. I was searching around on [Authentic Jobs](http://authenticjobs.com) and found an awesome post for a Front-end Drupal Developer...in San Francisco.

Fast forward a few weeks (and an awesome trip!) later, and I've accepted the position. Off to the bay :)
