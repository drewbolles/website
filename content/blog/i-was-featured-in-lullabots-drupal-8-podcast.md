I was featured in Lullabot's recent Drupal podcast! We discuss the current [Drupal initiative](https://www.drupal.org/node/2645250) to include a client-side framework in Drupal core (Angular, Ember, React, etc). As with anything regarding JavaScript, this caused quite a stir in the community. I wrote a [post](https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/why-progressive-decoupling-drupals-front-end-bad-idea) about it, advocating **against** this proposal. You can check out the episode on their site, [here](https://www.lullabot.com/podcasts/drupalizeme-podcast/a-frontend-javascript-framework-in-drupal-core).
